# AWS Deep Racer
As an assingment for the class "Reinforcement Learning" we had to learn how to make a car drive by itself. Yes, I agree, it sounds like a cool assignment right? And it was, I think it was my favorite, and it was so addicting!

Amazon writes this on their page: "AWS DeepRacer gives you an interesting and fun way to get started with reinforcement learning (RL). RL is an advanced machine learning (ML) technique that takes a very different approach to training models than other machine learning methods. Its super power is that it learns very complex behaviors without requiring any labeled training data, and can make short term decisions while optimizing for a longer term goal.

* Build models in Amazon SageMaker and train, test, and iterate quickly and easily on the track in the AWS DeepRacer 3D racing simulator.
* Experience the thrill of the race in the real-world when you deploy your reinforcement learning model onto AWS DeepRacer.
* Compete in the world’s first global, autonomous racing league, to race for prizes and glory and a chance to advance to the Championship Cup."

Below you can see a GIF of my race and the scoreboard where I placed 3rd out of 17 participants in my group:

# Reinforcement Learning - Final
Due to the COVID situation our professor decided not to have an exam, rather we sent him a paper answering several questions. The report can be viewed [here](https://github.com/Jonashellevang/IE_MBD_2020/blob/master/Reinforcement%20Learning/Reinforcement%20Learning%20-%20Final%20Report.pdf), and the report answers these questions:
1. What is Reinforcement Learning and how is it different from other methods like Supervised or Unsupervised Learning
2. What are Markov Decision Process (MDP) and Bellman’s equation?
3. What is a Dynamic Programming (DP) method and how is it different from MDP methods?
4. What is a Multi-armed Bandit problem, and what are example applications of it in real-life?
5. Explain 2 algorithms for solving a Multi-Armed Bandit problem
6. What is the difference between Model-based and Model-free RL methods?, describe a method for each
7. What is the difference between On-policy and Off-policy RL methods?, describe a method for each
8. What are the advantages and disadvantages of Monte Carlo (MC) methods vs Temporal Difference (TD) methods?
9. What is SARSA and how is it different from Q-learning?
10. Describe the following three RL algorithms, and how these work in high level:
* Principal Policy Optimization (PPO)
* Meta-Q-learning
* Asynchronous Advantage Actor Critic (A3C)
