# Convolutional Neural Nets
As the first group assignment in "Machine Learning 3" we had to learn how to code CNNs, and as a bonus exercise, I created a [YOLOv3 Tutorial](https://github.com/Jonashellevang/IE_MBD_2020/tree/master/YOLOv3%20Tutorial).

Convolutional neural networks or convnets or CNNs are a type of neural networks specialized on images. CNNs appears in 1998 introduced in a paper by Le-cun and Bengio. They were inspired on the research in the 1950s and 1960s on the visually perception on the brain. The first Convolutional Neural Network was called Le-Net5 and was able to perform the MNIST task (recognize written digits).

For the three first exercises, our goal was to build a neural net for classifying cats and dogs images, use regularization techniques and the consept of Transfer Learning on the Flower dataset.
