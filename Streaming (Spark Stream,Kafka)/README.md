# Streaming Sentiment from Twitter
For our group assignment in "Stream Processing & Real-Time Analytics" we had a presentation where we had to create a prototype based on using Real-Time Streaming. We decided to do real-time streaming from twitter using the sentiment of the topic chosen.

This is the file structure:
* The file ["twit.ipynb"](https://github.com/Jonashellevang/IE_MBD_2020/blob/master/Streaming%20(Spark%20Stream%2CKafka)/twit.ipynb) was used to connect to twitter.
* The file ["ReadTweets.ipynb"](https://github.com/Jonashellevang/IE_MBD_2020/tree/master/Streaming%20(Spark%20Stream%2CKafka)) was used to read the tweets.
* The file ["Mention_Analysis.ipynb"](https://github.com/Jonashellevang/IE_MBD_2020/blob/master/Streaming%20(Spark%20Stream%2CKafka)/Mention_Analysis.ipynb) was used to create the dashboard.

It is not possible to see the dashboard since there are no real-time streaming running, but below is a screenshot of one of our analysis:
