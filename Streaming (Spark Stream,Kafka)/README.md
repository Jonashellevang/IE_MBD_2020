# Real-Time Streaming Sentiment from Twitter
For our group assignment in "Stream Processing & Real-Time Analytics" we had a presentation where we had to create a prototype based on using Real-Time Streaming. We decided to do real-time streaming from twitter using the sentiment of the topic chosen.

This is the file structure:
* The file ["twit.ipynb"](https://github.com/Jonashellevang/IE_MBD_2020/blob/master/Streaming%20(Spark%20Stream%2CKafka)/twit.ipynb) was used to connect to twitter.
* The file ["ReadTweets.ipynb"](https://github.com/Jonashellevang/IE_MBD_2020/tree/master/Streaming%20(Spark%20Stream%2CKafka)) was used to read the tweets.
* The file ["Mention_Analysis.ipynb"](https://github.com/Jonashellevang/IE_MBD_2020/blob/master/Streaming%20(Spark%20Stream%2CKafka)/Mention_Analysis.ipynb) was used to create the dashboard.

It is not possible to see the dashboard since there are no real-time streaming running, but below is a screenshot of one of our analysis:

# Twitter Streaming with Spark Stream and Kafka
Getting data from twitter in almost near real-time has many different use cases. For instance, a corporation may have the option to automatically track what people are tweeting about their brand in near real-time. Also, it may be possible to interact automatically with customers through twitter by developing a bot.

Although this assignment is somewhat similar to the assignment above, it made us able to demonstrated our knowledge with Twitter. The report is quite self explanatory, so have a look at it by clicking [this link](https://github.com/Jonashellevang/IE_MBD_2020/blob/master/Streaming%20(Spark%20Stream%2CKafka)/Twitter%20Streaming%20with%20Spark%20Stream%20and%20Kafka%20Report.pdf).
