# LSTMs For Time Series
This pracitce file is a tutorial from Tensorflow that I used and played with after our session about RNN and LSTM in "Machine Learning 3" class. Although it does not show my own work in the terms that this file is provided, it gave me the knowledge on how to do this on my own. The file can be accessed by clicking [this link](https://github.com/Jonashellevang/IE_MBD_2020/blob/master/LSTM%20(Tensorflow)/LSTMs%20for%20time%20series.ipynb).
