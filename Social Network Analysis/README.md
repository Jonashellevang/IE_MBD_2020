# MongoDB and HBase Summary
I didn't have much work for HBase as it was not a part of an assignment. I therefore decided to upload my summary document I used to prepare for the Exam that I got full marks on. It's not the cleanest document as it was meant for personal use, but hopefully it will either help you or show you what I know. By clicking [this link](https://github.com/Jonashellevang/IE_MBD_2020/blob/master/NoSQL%20(MongoDB%2CHBase)/MongoDB%20and%20HBase%20Summary.pdf) or clicking the file "MongoDB and HBase Summary.pdf" you can see the work done.

# MongoDB
