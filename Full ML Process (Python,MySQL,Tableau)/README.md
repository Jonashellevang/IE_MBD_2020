# Python + SQL + Tableau: Integrating Python, SQL, and Tableau

I wanted to learn the whle process from preprocessing and deploying a machine learning model in python, to storing the data to visualizing with Tableau, which is why the "[Python + SQL + Tableau: Integrating Python, SQL, and Tableau](https://www.udemy.com/course/python-sql-tableau-integrating-python-sql-and-tableau/)" on Udemy by 365 Careers was a good choice.

In the file called "[Absenteeism - Preprocessing.ipynb](https://github.com/Jonashellevang/IE_MBD_2020/blob/master/Full%20ML%20Process%20(Python,MySQL,Tableau)/Absenteeism%20-%20Preprocessing.ipynb)" I did all the pre-processing steps, and from there I moved on to creating a machine learning model and saving the model in the file "[Absenteeism - Logistic Regression.ipynb](https://github.com/Jonashellevang/IE_MBD_2020/blob/master/Full%20ML%20Process%20(Python,MySQL,Tableau)/Absenteeism%20-%20Logistic%20Regression.ipynb)". I put the saved machine learning model into a [python package](https://github.com/Jonashellevang/IE_MBD_2020/blob/master/Full%20ML%20Process%20(Python,MySQL,Tableau)/absenteeism_module.py) with the obligatory [pyproject.toml file](https://github.com/Jonashellevang/IE_MBD_2020/blob/master/Full%20ML%20Process%20(Python,MySQL,Tableau)/pyproject.toml) for using the machine learning model on other data in a new notebook. The notebook is called "[Absenteeism - Integration.ipynb](https://github.com/Jonashellevang/IE_MBD_2020/blob/master/Full%20ML%20Process%20(Python,MySQL,Tableau)/Absenteeism%20-%20Integration.ipynb)", and this very same notebook was also used to connect to MySQL Workbench with the python package called "pymysql" to connect a bridge between Jupyter Notebook and MySQL Workbench. The queries run in MySQL can be accessed by clicking [this link](https://github.com/Jonashellevang/IE_MBD_2020/blob/master/Full%20ML%20Process%20(Python,MySQL,Tableau)/MySQL-Queries.sql).

I also made some very simple illustrations in Tableau as instructed in the exercise. Although these are rediculously simple illustrations, they can really show the HR department some insights on who is more likely to be absent from work with either reason_1, reason_2, reason_3 or reason_4. However, reason_2 had no scenarios and was taken out of the illustration for that reason. You can see the visualization in Tableau Public by clicking [this link](https://public.tableau.com/profile/jonas.hellevang#!/vizhome/AbsenteeismfromWork_15982097719720/AbsenteeismfromWork).
