# 23andMe Report
For my "Big Data & Health" class we had to write a report based on our personal opinions about the case between the FDA in the United States of America and 23andMe. 

23andMe is one of the first consumer based genetic testing companies, co-founded by Anne Wojcicki in Silicon Valley in 2006. In 2007, the company, together with two other companies, announced that they were going to start selling Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) chip genetic testing kits directly to consumers, which would lead to easy access at an affordable price. The SNP chip genetic testing kits sequences only parts of the genome, which is why it could be done cheaper and faster than the first methods, you simply spit and wait for the results. Their plan to sell directly to consumers was met with skepticism and concerns as this had previously only been available through doctors, and that the consumer would not know how to interpret this data. However, the sale started, at a low speed, only boosted by increased awareness due to Angelina Jolie testing and openly speaking about her results.
Despite the free publicity from Angelina Jolie and boost in sales, Wojcicki’s original goal of reaching one million customers by the end of 2013 was not met, only reaching 450,000 consumers.

As a response to low numbers in customers, the company spent $5 million on television, radio and direct mail advertisement in August 2013 to target a new set of customers.

During this whole process, FDA had been involved trying to regularize this new profound innovation. The process demanded many resources from both the genome companies and the FDA, leading to a mess of an outcome for 23andMe and Wojcicki to solve, where they received a letter addressing their lack of cooperation, and seizure of further sales of medical tests.

# Healthcare Presentation
For my "Introduction to Big Data and Analytics" course we had to chose a topic of interest to present to the rest of our classmates. I chose to look further into the healthcare industry, and how this industry can be transformed the coming years.

# SmellAway - Personal Health Manager
As our last group project we had to building an innovative data based product or service to improve the way people manage their health, with the goal of improving their health outcomes and customer health experience. Our answer to this was SmellAway!

Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) are vapors at ordinary room temperature, and our bodies release these chemicals all the time. This is why dogs are so prone to detect if someone is sick, or even sad, because they can smell it. If you have or have had a dog in your life, and maybe you have only heard of the concept, dogs can sense when you are sad, depressed or not feeling well in some sort of way. Your dog tries to cheer you up because it senses these things, which is what we build our idea on. We want to detect these abnormalities of smells.

Imagine if you can use some sort of device on a weekly or daily basis that could track how your body sent is evolving. Imagine if this device could detect changes of your body odor or breath when you are stressed out it will know, if you are starting to get depressed it will know, and if you have a cancer cell starting to grow inside you, it will know. It will know all of this information, and at the same time it can add this information to you history of VOCs, combine it with data about you such as age, sex, height, weight, and numerous other variables.

# The Blood Test Makeover
The typical blood test report is an exercise in obfuscation, a document that needs to be translated by a lab technician or physician, and that’s if you somehow manage to see a copy of your results. In many US states, it’s illegal for a laboratory to send test results directly to a patient—a regulatory puzzle that leads some labs to simply deny direct results to any customer, anywhere. The blood may be yours—but the information it contains is not.

The task was to improve the way a typical blood test report conveys information using our dataviz skills and our intuitions about what could improve the patient experience. We created a prototype and presentation for this assignment.
