# Data Iintegration Design (Pentaho)
During the first and second assignment we created a data warehouse and data integration processes. This third assignment was done on an individual basis and focused on generating value from our data warehouse by designing a dashboard using Tableau.

## The two previous Assignments:
* [Data Warehouse Modelling (MySQL)](https://github.com/Jonashellevang/IE_MBD_2020/tree/master/Data%20Warehouse%20Modelling%20(MySQL))
* [Data Integration Design (Pentaho)](https://github.com/Jonashellevang/IE_MBD_2020/tree/master/Data%20Integration%20Design%20(Pentaho))

## Deliverables
