# Worldwide Alcohol and Tobacco Consumption (R - ggplot)
For our first assignment in our "Data Visualization" class we had to create a ggplot with several plots where we had plots that was both moving and not moving. Since there are so many plots for this one, not all of them are shown here, but if you would like to check them all out, please [check out the PDF of our R-Markdown](https://github.com/Jonashellevang/IE_MBD_2020/blob/master/Data%20Visualization%20(Tableau%2CR%2CCarto%2CD3.js)/R%20-%20ggplot/Worldwide%20Alcohol%20and%20Tobacco%20Consumption.pdf). If you want to see the moving plots as well, I recommend you [download the HTML file](https://github.com/Jonashellevang/IE_MBD_2020/blob/master/Data%20Visualization%20(Tableau%2CR%2CCarto%2CD3.js)/R%20-%20ggplot/Worldwide%20Alcohol%20and%20Tobacco%20Consumption.html).

### General Findings:

1. The average alcohol consumption has been consistently decreasing in the OCDE countries, this is mainly because in europe (the one that has more countries) has been consistently decresing. Also the distribution of the alcohol consumptions has narrowed through the years.


2. Like Alcohol, Tobacco has seen a sharp decrease in the amount of tobacco consumption thanks to Europe. The main difference in this case is that some countries have started to become bigger outliers and decreased their consumption far less then the average (bigger outliers).


3. As both consumptions have decreased throught time, we can see a stronger decrease in tobacco compared to alcohol. After looking at the dynamic scatter plot we can see a consistent behaviour toward decresing both alcohol and tobacco together.
