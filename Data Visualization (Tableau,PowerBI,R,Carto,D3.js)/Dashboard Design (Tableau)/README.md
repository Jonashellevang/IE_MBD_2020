# Dashboard Design (Tableau)
During the first and second assignment of the class "Business Intelligence & Datawarehousing" we created a data warehouse and data integration processes. This third assignment was done on an individual basis and focused on generating value from our data warehouse by designing a dashboard using Tableau.

The dashboard is created having the Sales Managers of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) in mind, giving them an overview of the status of licenses specified as all, active, cancelled, expired and terminated. You can play with the visualization by clicking [this link](https://public.tableau.com/profile/jonas.hellevang#!/vizhome/FederalCommunicationsCommissionCustomersandAntennas/Dashboard).
