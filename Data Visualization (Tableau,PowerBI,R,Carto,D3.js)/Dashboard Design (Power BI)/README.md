# Senesco - A Data Analysis Report w/Power BI (in Norwegian)

The report is in Norwegian, and can be accessed by [clicking this link](https://github.com/Jonashellevang/IE_MBD_2020/blob/master/Data%20Visualization%20(Tableau%2CPowerBI%2CR%2CCarto%2CD3.js)/Dashboard%20Design%20(Power%20BI)/Senesco%20Case.pdf).

Although these images aren't interactive, they represent the three dashboards I made for this project:
