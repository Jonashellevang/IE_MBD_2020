# Disaster Tweets (Kaggle)
On a general note, this assignment was in particular interesting because even though concepts and theory from class was understood, we still had not run any sort of machine learning process like this. It was not until after the process of EDA I understood that when we vectorize the text, creating new features and doing “normal” machine learning processes are completely different. For me, that was the biggest discovery of this assignment. The machine learning process is way different, and that highlights the importance of proper cleaning and processing of the text.

We used the Kaggle competiton [Real or Not? NLP with Disaster Tweets](https://www.kaggle.com/c/nlp-getting-started), and both the report and python notebook is incluced in this repository. You can access the notebook by clicking the file "Disaster Tweets.ipynb" or [this link](https://github.com/Jonashellevang/IE_MBD_2020/blob/master/Natural%20Language%20Processing/Disaster%20Tweets.ipynb) and the report can be accessed by clicking the file "Disaster Tweets Report.pdf" or [this link](https://github.com/Jonashellevang/IE_MBD_2020/blob/master/Natural%20Language%20Processing/Disaster%20Tweets%20Report.pdf).
