# Creating Functions
For this group assignment we had to create different functions to obtain the information asked for:
1. Create a function read_savings_data that reads the file named bank.csv and returns a list of dictionaries.
2. Create a function calculate_total_savings, that receives a list of dictionaries like the one resulting from read_savings_data, and computes the total savings of all clients in the bank. Do not use the function sum provided by Python.
3. Create a function richest_person, that receives a list of dictionares like the one resulting from read_savings_data, and returns the name of the person that has the highest amount of money.
4. Create a function poorest_person, that receives a list of dictionaries like the one resulting from read_savings_data, and returns the name of the person that has the lowest amount of money.
5. Create a function get_all_countries, that receives a list of dictionaries like the one resulting from read_savings_data, and returns a list of all different countries, with no duplicates.
6. Create a function calculate_average_savings, that receives a list of dictionaries like the one resulting from read_savings_data, and returns the average savings of all people in the bank. Do not use the function sum provided by Python.
7. Create a function people_per_country, that receives a list of dictionaries like the one resulting from read_savings_data, and returns a dictionary where the keys are the different countries in the input, and the values are the number of people that are from each country.
8. Create a function write_report, that writes a report in a file named report.json.

# Energy Analysis
This was an individual assignment where I used a dataset for energy in Spain. By clicking [this link](https://github.com/Jonashellevang/IE_MBD_2020/blob/master/Python/Energy%20Analysis.ipynb) or clicking the file "Energy Analysis.ipynb" you can see the work done.

# IMDb Analysis
This was an individual assignment where I used a dataset for IMDb and analyzed the data. By clicking [this link](https://github.com/Jonashellevang/IE_MBD_2020/blob/master/Python/IMDb%20Analysis.ipynb) or clicking the file "IMDb Analysis.ipynb" you can see the work done.
