# IBM Watson - Edwin, The Educational Chatbot
For the class "Watson Challenge" we had to create a chatbot based on our own idea, where we decided to create a chatbot for MOOC's in the educational sector that we named "Edwin". The jury liked the chatbot itself, but the idea is not as scalable as other chatbots, which my team and I agree with. This chatbot can however help when watching videos, replacing teachers because the chatbot will be ble to answer your questions. 

You can test the chatbot by pressing [this link,](https://web-chat.global.assistant.watson.cloud.ibm.com/preview.html?region=eu-gb&integrationID=e434435f-f7dd-43c6-a17b-5b501a634d36&serviceInstanceID=735ddf0c-d549-441d-acc6-586cd33aaffb) and it you want to see the video the chatbot is based on, you can [visit the YouTube video here!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-EtmaFJieY&list=PL8dPuuaLjXtNlUrzyH5r6jN9ulIgZBpdo&t=332s)

The actual chatbot has been downloaded for you to use and build on if you wish, and all you have to do is download Edwin.json to your computer and upload it to IBM Watson Assistant.
