# IBM Watson - Educational Chatbot
For the class "Watson Challenge" we had to create a chatbot based on our own idea, where we decided to create a chatbot for MOOC's in the educational sector. Although the idea is not as scalable as other chatbots, this chatbot could help when watching videos, replacing teachers because the chatbot will be ble to answer your questions.
