# Forecasting w/Non-Seasonality
In the first assignment in "Forecasting Time Series" class we had to do the following tasks with the data that was provided to us:
1.	Plot the series, its correlogram and its histogram.
2.	Using the information in the previous plots, discuss whether the series is stationary, has a marginal Normal distribution, is white noise, strict white noise or Gaussian white noise, the dynamic dependence of the series can be represented by a linear model and if there are potential non-linear dependences
3.	For the non-stationary time series, justify the proper transformation to stationarity, and respond the same questions in 2 for the transformed stationary data.
4.	Finally, justify your previous answers using basic statistics and formal tests when available.

# Forecasting w/Seasonality
In the second assignment in "Forecasting Time Series" class we had to do the following tasks with the data that was provided to us:
1.	Find at least two linear time series models, using the Box-Jenkins methodology, for the quarterly earnings per share of Coca-Cola Company from the first quarter of 1983 to the third quarter of 2009. Identify your models using the entire available sample.
2.	For the models identified in the previous step, leave for example the last 24 real values to compare all the models in terms of forecasting (out of sample forecasting exercise). What is the best model and why is this your choice?
