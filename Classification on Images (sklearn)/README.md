# Classifying Cars, Planes and Trains
In this "Computer Vision" class assignment I experimented with various models trying to predict the 3 different commute machines from the VOC dataset. Various methods and pre-processing steps was tried out, where the selected best one used on the Decision Tree Classifier was used on other machine learning models as well to predict if it is a plane, automobile or a train.
