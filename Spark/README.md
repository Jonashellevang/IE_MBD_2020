# Analyzing Flight Data
According to a 2010 report made by the US Federal Aviation Administration, the economic price of domestic flight delays entails a yearly cost of 32.9 billion dollars to passengers, airlines and other parts of the economy. More than half of that amount comes from passengers' pockets, as they do not only waste time waiting for their planes to leave, but also miss connecting flights, spend money on food and have to sleep on hotel rooms while they're stranded.

The work done answers these questions:
1. Is there a relation between the economic prosperity of a city and the proportion of flights that arrive to it during the weekdays or weekends?
2. Is there any relation between the business nature of a city and the proportion of flights that arrive early in the morning (e.g. with people in a business travel) with respect to the number of flights arriving during the rest of the day?
3. Is this proportion between flights arriving in the morning and the afternoon much different if we compare weekdays vs weekends in those cities?
4. Are there cities that receive most flights at weekends? Is this typical of a vacation city?
5. Can we say more developed cities suffer of smaller arrival delays on average?
6. Is there a relation between the arrival time and the arrival delay? If you deem necessary, categorize the day into discrete parts for the arrival time. Is the relation the same for all categories of cities?
7. What about the departure time?

# San Francisco Flight Analysis
This assignment was the last assignment where I used everything I learned in class. Although I wouldn’t say that San Francisco is known for its crime, rather for its bridge and steep hills and houses. Still crime is everywhere, and it is interesting to see how this can be reduced. So how can we help the police of San Francisco, or SFPD, with its crime fighting? I have focused the analysis on location, time and severity of crime, and by doing so we can provide SFPD with facts such as in what areas there is most crime, what day crime happens the most and where. 

The best way to view the work is to read the report above called "San Francisco Crime Analysis (2018 until today) Report.pdf" or by [this link](https://github.com/Jonashellevang/IE_MBD_2020/blob/master/Spark/San%20Francisco%20Crime%20Analysis%20(2018%20until%20today)%20Report.pdf). If you wish to see the python file you can as well by clicking the file above "San Francisco Crime Analysis (2018 until today).ipynb" or through [this link](https://github.com/Jonashellevang/IE_MBD_2020/blob/master/Spark/San%20Francisco%20Crime%20Analysis%20(2018%20until%20today).ipynb).
