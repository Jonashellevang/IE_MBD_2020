# Analyzing Flight Data
According to a 2010 report made by the US Federal Aviation Administration, the economic price of domestic flight delays entails a yearly cost of 32.9 billion dollars to passengers, airlines and other parts of the economy. More than half of that amount comes from passengers' pockets, as they do not only waste time waiting for their planes to leave, but also miss connecting flights, spend money on food and have to sleep on hotel rooms while they're stranded.

The work done answers these questions:
1. Is there a relation between the economic prosperity of a city and the proportion of flights that arrive to it during the weekdays or weekends?
2. Is there any relation between the business nature of a city and the proportion of flights that arrive early in the morning (e.g. with people in a business travel) with respect to the number of flights arriving during the rest of the day?
3. Is this proportion between flights arriving in the morning and the afternoon much different if we compare weekdays vs weekends in those cities?
4. Are there cities that receive most flights at weekends? Is this typical of a vacation city?
5. Can we say more developed cities suffer of smaller arrival delays on average?
6. Is there a relation between the arrival time and the arrival delay? If you deem necessary, categorize the day into discrete parts for the arrival time. Is the relation the same for all categories of cities?
7. What about the departure time?
