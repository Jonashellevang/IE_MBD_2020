# Protecting The Endangered - Saving Elephants With YOLOv3
Lately, the large mammal populations have been declining dramatically each year. Especially concerned are the elephants, the largest land animals are slowly falling into the extinct list of animals. They are especially being poached for their ivory tusks which are used for jewelry and luxurious furniture elements. Ivory tusks trades are illegal but there is still a growing market for it in Asia, highlighting the continuous threat to the animal.

As a result, the estimated population of elephants decreased from 12 million to 400 000 in the last century alone according to the WWF. Moreover, an estimated 20,000 elephants are poached for their tusks every year.

This is where our proposed solution using computer vision comes in. Our idea is to use real- time object detection coupled with readily available drones in order to partly solve problem of poaching and animal extinction in general. Indeed, with advancement in technology, drones are becoming cheaper and more powerful each year. And with the development of machine learning model in computer vision, we believe that we could develop performant models at affordable prices.

As a result the drone would be sending real-time streams to a control room where our custom-trained object detector could help with:
1. Precise control of population of endangered species;
2. Poaching control;
3. Control of movement of animals in order to save them from especially dangerous
zones.

Our solution focused on points 1 and 2 mainly as we trained our various models to recognize animals (especially elephants) from aerial shots.
