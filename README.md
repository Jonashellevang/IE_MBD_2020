# [Big Data & Health]()
### 23andMe: Genetic Testing for Consumers Report
For my "Big Data & Health" class we had to write a report based on our personal opinions about the case between the FDA in the USA and 23andMe. The report can be accessed [here](https://github.com/Jonashellevang/IE_MBD_2020/blob/master/Big%20Data%20%26%20Health/23andMe%20Report.pdf).

### Healthcare Presentation
For my "Introduction to Big Data and Analytics" course we had to chose a topic of interest to present to the rest of our classmates. I chose to look further into the healthcare industry, and how this industry can be transformed the coming years. The presentation can be accessed [here](https://github.com/Jonashellevang/IE_MBD_2020/blob/master/Big%20Data%20%26%20Health/Healtcare%20Presentation%20-%20Intro%20to%20Big%20Data.pdf).

### Lung Cancer (sckit-learn) Forum Post
In "Computer Vision" class we had to demonstrate the use of some image preprocessing techniques using sckit-learn. I wanted to see if there was any preprocessing techniques that would highlight the presence of cancer in a person's x-rays, and from experimenting with a few techniques, where I used thresholding. The forum post can be accessed [here](https://github.com/Jonashellevang/IE_MBD_2020/tree/master/Big%20Data%20%26%20Health#lung-cancer-sckit-learn).

### SmellAway - Personal Health Manager Presentation
As our last group project for "Big Data & Health" class we had to building an innovative data based product or service to improve the way people manage their health, with the goal of improving their health outcomes and customer health experience. Our answer to this was SmellAway! The presentation can be accessed [here](https://github.com/Jonashellevang/IE_MBD_2020/blob/master/Big%20Data%20%26%20Health/SmellAway%20Presentation.pdf).

### The Blood Test Makeover Presentation
The task in "Big Data & Health" class was to improve the way a typical blood test report conveys information using our dataviz skills and our intuitions about what could improve the patient experience. We created a prototype and presentation for this assignment. The presentation can be accessed [here](https://github.com/Jonashellevang/IE_MBD_2020/blob/master/Big%20Data%20%26%20Health/The%20Blood%20Test%20Makeover%20Presentation.pdf).

### Your.md (Now Healthily) App Presentation
Your.md, now changed name to Healthily, is a free app where anyone, anywhere can find safe and personalised information, guidance and support for their health. This was a very quick presentation. The presentation can be accessed [here](https://github.com/Jonashellevang/IE_MBD_2020/blob/master/Big%20Data%20%26%20Health/your.md%20Presentation.pdf).

# [CNN (Tensorflow,Keras)](https://github.com/Jonashellevang/IE_MBD_2020/tree/master/CNN%20(Tensorflow%2CKeras))
### Convolutional Neural Nets
As the first group assignment in "Machine Learning 3" we had to learn how to code CNNs, and as a bonus exercise, I created a [YOLOv3 Tutorial](https://github.com/Jonashellevang/IE_MBD_2020/tree/master/YOLOv3%20Tutorial). For the three first exercises, our goal was to build a neural net for classifying cats and dogs images, use regularization techniques and the consept of Transfer Learning on the Flower dataset.

The report can be accessed [here](https://github.com/Jonashellevang/IE_MBD_2020/blob/master/CNN%20(Tensorflow%2CKeras)/CNN%20Report.pdf), and the exercise files can be accessed here:

### How to Avoid Overfitting
As part of a forum exercise in "Computer Vision" class I wrote a short paragraph about how to avoid overfitting in CNNs. This can be accessed [here](https://github.com/Jonashellevang/IE_MBD_2020/tree/master/CNN%20(Tensorflow%2CKeras)#how-to-avoid-overfitting).

# [CRISP-DM Methodology](https://github.com/Jonashellevang/IE_MBD_2020/tree/master/CRISP-DM%20Methodology)
### CRISP-DM Methodology Guide w/Practical Examples
For our "The Knowledge Discovery Process" class we created a guide that can be used for you as a member of the analytical team of a company. We have presented a guide with examples for each phase of the CRISP-DM process, showing hands on which steps to take in each phase. The guide will teach you how to deal with each problem, and how to avoid mistakes or duplicate of work from any team that might be involved in the process.

# [Classification (sklearn,matplotlib)](https://github.com/Jonashellevang/IE_MBD_2020/tree/master/Classification%20(sklearn%2Cmatplotlib))
### HR Analytics - Predicting Turnover For A Large Company (Kaggle)
This is a binary Kaggle competition using the HR Analytics dataset including explanatory variables of around 15k employees of a large company. The goal of the case study was to model the probability of attrition (employees leaving, either on their own or because they got fired) of each individual, as well as to understand which variables are the most important ones and need to be addressed the right away. Link to the competition can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/lnvardanyan/hr-analytics), and the python notebook can be found by clicking [this link](https://github.com/Jonashellevang/IE_MBD_2020/blob/master/Classification%20(sklearn%2Cmatplotlib)/Predicting%20Turnover.ipynb).

### Pump it Up: Data Mining the Water Table (DrivenData)
This is a multi-class DrivenData competition done using data from Taarifa and the Tanzanian Ministry of Water where the objective is to predict which water pumps are functional or need repairs. It was done as a group assignment as part of our "Machine Learning II" coursework using Python. The final result achieved was a classification rate of 0.8129 (top 10%). Link to the competition can be found [here](https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/7/pump-it-up-data-mining-the-water-table/), and the python notebook can be accessed through [this link](https://github.com/Jonashellevang/IE_MBD_2020/blob/master/Classification%20(sklearn%2Cmatplotlib)/Water%20Pump%20Prediction.ipynb).

# [Classification on Images (sklearn)](https://github.com/Jonashellevang/IE_MBD_2020/tree/master/Classification%20on%20Images%20(sklearn))
### Classifying Cars, Planes and Trains
In this "Computer Vision" class assignment I experimented with various models trying to predict the 3 different commute machines from the VOC dataset. Various methods and pre-processing steps was tried out, where the selected best pre-processing step used on the Decision Tree Classifier was used on other machine learning models to predict if it is a plane, automobile or a train. The notebook can be reviewed by clicking [this link](https://github.com/Jonashellevang/IE_MBD_2020/blob/master/Classification%20on%20Images%20(sklearn)/Classifying%20Cars%2C%20Planes%20and%20Trains.ipynb).

# [Cluster Analysis (Dataiku)](https://github.com/Jonashellevang/IE_MBD_2020/tree/master/Cluster%20Analysis%20(Dataiku))
### Cluster Analysis for a Retail Company
The report summarizes the Cluster analysis done to the stores of a retail company located in Bogotá. This data was given by a real retail company with the objective of classifying their stores in categories based on the demographic and sales data at hand, to better distribute the product portfolio in their stores to maximize sales. To view the report you can click [this link](https://github.com/Jonashellevang/IE_MBD_2020/blob/master/Cluster%20Analysis%20(Dataiku)/Cluster%20Analysis%20Report.pdf), and to view the presentation you can click [this link](https://github.com/Jonashellevang/IE_MBD_2020/blob/master/Cluster%20Analysis%20(Dataiku)/Cluster%20Analysis%20Presentation.pdf).

# [Computer Vision (YOLOv3)](https://github.com/Jonashellevang/IE_MBD_2020/tree/master/Computer%20Vision%20(YOLOv3))
### Protecting The Endangered - Saving Elephants With YOLOv3
The estimated population of elephants decreased from 12 million to 400 000 in the last century alone according to the WWF. Moreover, an estimated 20,000 elephants are poached for their tusks every year. Our aim of this "Computer Vision" project was to provide a solution where a drone would be sending real-time streams to a control room where our custom-trained object detector could help with:

1. Precise control of population of endangered species;
2. Poaching control;
3. Control of movement of animals in order to save them from especially dangerous
zones.

The notebook is quite long due to all the coding, but can be accessed by clicking [this link](https://github.com/Jonashellevang/IE_MBD_2020/blob/master/Computer%20Vision%20(YOLOv3)/Saving%20Elephants%20with%20YOLOv3.ipynb).
