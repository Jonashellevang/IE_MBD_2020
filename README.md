### HR Analytics - Predicting Turnover For A Large Company (Kaggle)
This is a binary Kaggle competition using the HR Analytics dataset including explanatory variables of around 15k employees of a large company. The goal of the case study was to model the probability of attrition (employees leaving, either on their own or because they got fired) of each individual, as well as to understand which variables are the most important ones and need to be addressed the right away. Link to the competition can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/lnvardanyan/hr-analytics), and the python notebook can be found by clicking [this link](https://github.com/Jonashellevang/IE_MBD_2020/blob/master/Classification%20(sklearn%2Cmatplotlib)/Predicting%20Turnover.ipynb).

### Protecting The Endangered - Saving Elephants With YOLOv3
The estimated population of elephants decreased from 12 million to 400 000 in the last century alone according to the WWF. Moreover, an estimated 20,000 elephants are poached for their tusks every year. Our aim of this "Computer Vision" project was to provide a solution where a drone would be sending real-time streams to a control room where our custom-trained object detector could help with:

1. Precise control of population of endangered species;
2. Poaching control;
3. Control of movement of animals in order to save them from especially dangerous
zones.

The notebook is quite long due to all the coding, but can be accessed by clicking [this link](https://github.com/Jonashellevang/IE_MBD_2020/blob/master/Computer%20Vision%20(YOLOv3)/Saving%20Elephants%20with%20YOLOv3.ipynb).

# [(1/3) Data Warehouse Modelling (MySQL)](https://github.com/Jonashellevang/IE_MBD_2020/tree/master/Data%20Warehouse%20Modelling%20(MySQL))
This was the first group assignment out of two in "Business Intelligence and Datawarehousing" class where we got delivered a dataset and as a group had to present a:
* Data Set analysis
* Data Warehouse Approach Selection
* Data Warehouse Design

# [(2/3) Data Integration Design (Pentaho)](https://github.com/Jonashellevang/IE_MBD_2020/tree/master/Data%20Integration%20Design%20(Pentaho))
This second assignment was focused on Data Integration with Pentaho. It consisted on designing a one-time historic data load using an ETL (Extraction, Transformation, Loading) tool. That means we had to create an ETL process for each dimension and fact table(s) from the previous assignment.

# [Data Visualization (Tableau,R,Carto,D3.js)](https://github.com/Jonashellevang/IE_MBD_2020/tree/master/Data%20Visualization%20(Tableau%2CR%2CCarto%2CD3.js))
### (3/3) Dashboard Design (Tableau)
This third assignment "Business Intelligence and Datawarehousing" class was done on an individual basis and focused on generating value from our datawarehouse by designing a dashboard using Tableau. You can play with the visualization by clicking [this link](https://public.tableau.com/profile/jonas.hellevang#!/vizhome/FederalCommunicationsCommissionCustomersandAntennas/Dashboard).

### One week of Jonas' Sleep (D3.js)
As a group assignment for our "Data Visualization" class we decided to create a visualization of my sleep where we chose a random week of the year. I have a love of electronic devices, and have tracked movement, sleep, and other health data for years through alarm clock's, weight scales, Apple Watch and my iPhone. It was fun to see how it was possible to visualize some of this data.

# [Forecasting Time Series (R)](https://github.com/Jonashellevang/IE_MBD_2020/tree/master/Forecasting%20Time%20Series%20(R))
### Forecasting w/Non-Seasonality (R)
In the first assignment in "Forecasting Time Series" class we had to do the following tasks with the data that was provided to us:
1.	Plot the series, its correlogram and its histogram.
2.	Using the information in the previous plots, discuss whether the series is stationary, has a marginal Normal distribution, is white noise, strict white noise or Gaussian white noise, the dynamic dependence of the series can be represented by a linear model and if there are potential non-linear dependences
3.	For the non-stationary time series, justify the proper transformation to stationarity, and respond the same questions in 2 for the transformed stationary data.
4.	Finally, justify your previous answers using basic statistics and formal tests when available.

The result can be viewed by clicking [this link](https://github.com/Jonashellevang/IE_MBD_2020/blob/master/Forecasting%20Time%20Series%20(R)/Non-seasonality.pdf).

### Forecasting w/Seasonality (R)
In the second assignment in "Forecasting Time Series" class we had to do the following tasks with the data that was provided to us:
1.	Find at least two linear time series models, using the Box-Jenkins methodology, for the quarterly earnings per share of Coca-Cola Company from the first quarter of 1983 to the third quarter of 2009. Identify your models using the entire available sample.
2.	For the models identified in the previous step, leave for example the last 24 real values to compare all the models in terms of forecasting (out of sample forecasting exercise). What is the best model and why is this your choice?

# [Full ML Process (Python,MySQL,Tableau)](https://github.com/Jonashellevang/IE_MBD_2020/tree/master/Full%20ML%20Process%20(Python%2CMySQL%2CTableau))
### Python + SQL + Tableau: Integrating Python, SQL, and Tableau

I wanted to learn the whole process from preprocessing and deploying a machine learning model in python, to storing the data to visualizing with Tableau, which is why the "[Python + SQL + Tableau: Integrating Python, SQL, and Tableau](https://www.udemy.com/course/python-sql-tableau-integrating-python-sql-and-tableau/)" course on Udemy by 365 Careers was a good choice.

In the file called "[Absenteeism - Preprocessing.ipynb](https://github.com/Jonashellevang/IE_MBD_2020/blob/master/Full%20ML%20Process%20(Python,MySQL,Tableau)/Absenteeism%20-%20Preprocessing.ipynb)" I did all the pre-processing steps, and from there I moved on to creating a machine learning model and saving the model in the file "[Absenteeism - Logistic Regression.ipynb](https://github.com/Jonashellevang/IE_MBD_2020/blob/master/Full%20ML%20Process%20(Python,MySQL,Tableau)/Absenteeism%20-%20Logistic%20Regression.ipynb)". I put the saved machine learning model into a [python package](https://github.com/Jonashellevang/IE_MBD_2020/blob/master/Full%20ML%20Process%20(Python,MySQL,Tableau)/absenteeism_module.py) with the obligatory [pyproject.toml file](https://github.com/Jonashellevang/IE_MBD_2020/blob/master/Full%20ML%20Process%20(Python,MySQL,Tableau)/pyproject.toml) for using the machine learning model on other data in a new notebook. The notebook is called "[Absenteeism - Integration.ipynb](https://github.com/Jonashellevang/IE_MBD_2020/blob/master/Full%20ML%20Process%20(Python,MySQL,Tableau)/Absenteeism%20-%20Integration.ipynb)", and this very same notebook was also used to connect to MySQL Workbench with the python package called "pymysql" to connect a bridge between Jupyter Notebook and MySQL Workbench. The queries run in MySQL can be accessed by clicking [this link](https://github.com/Jonashellevang/IE_MBD_2020/blob/master/Full%20ML%20Process%20(Python,MySQL,Tableau)/MySQL-Queries.sql).

I also made some very simple illustrations in Tableau as instructed in the exercise. Although these are rediculously simple illustrations, they can really show the HR department some insights on who is more likely to be absent from work with either reason_1, reason_2, reason_3 or reason_4. However, reason_2 had no scenarios and was taken out of the illustration for that reason. You can see the visualization in Tableau Public by clicking [this link](https://public.tableau.com/profile/jonas.hellevang#!/vizhome/AbsenteeismfromWork_15982097719720/AbsenteeismfromWork).

### Deep Generative Adverserial Nets
In this group assignment in "Machine Learning III" class we pursued the following objectives:
- To understand and create our own Generative Adversarial Neural Nets
- To evolve them to create Conditional Adversarial Neural Nets

The topic is described further in the report that you can access by clicking [this link](https://github.com/Jonashellevang/IE_MBD_2020/blob/master/GANs%20and%20CGANs%20(Tensorflow)/GANs%20and%20CGANs%20Report.pdf).

# [Hadoop](https://github.com/Jonashellevang/IE_MBD_2020/tree/master/Hadoop)
### Cloudera and Dell - Big Data Use Case
For "Hadoop" Class we had to write about a big data use case. I chose to write about DELL and Cloudera where I looked at the issue from a technical point of view in order to learn and understand the solution. The report can be accessed by clicking [this link](https://github.com/Jonashellevang/IE_MBD_2020/blob/master/Hadoop/Cloudera%20and%20Dell%20-%20Big%20Data%20Use%20Case.pdf).

### Apache Hive Queries
For "Hadoop" class we had to analyze the available data files from Twitter. The PDF-file with the required statements can be viewed by clicking [this link](https://github.com/Jonashellevang/IE_MBD_2020/blob/master/Hadoop/Apache%20Hive%20Queries.pdf).

# [IBM Watson Chatbot](https://github.com/Jonashellevang/IE_MBD_2020/tree/master/IBM%20Watson%20Chatbot)
### IBM Watson - Edwin, The Educational Chatbot
For the class "Watson Challenge" we had to create a chatbot based on our own idea, where we decided to create a chatbot for MOOC's in the educational sector that we named "Edwin". This chatbot can however help when watching videos, replacing teachers because the chatbot will be ble to answer your questions.

# [LSTM (Tensorflow)](https://github.com/Jonashellevang/IE_MBD_2020/tree/master/LSTM%20(Tensorflow))
### LSTMs For Time Series (Tensorflow)
This pracitce file is a tutorial from Tensorflow that I used and played with after our session about RNN and LSTM in "Machine Learning 3" class. Although it does not show my own work in the terms that this file is provided, it gave me the knowledge on how to do this on my own. The file can be accessed by clicking [this link](https://github.com/Jonashellevang/IE_MBD_2020/blob/master/LSTM%20(Tensorflow)/LSTMs%20for%20time%20series.ipynb).

### Inferential Statistics Report
This is a group assignment for "Math & Statistics for Data Analysis" class where we covered the results of a survey sent out to IE Master students about pizza and hamburger preferences and the following statistical analysis of those results. The objective of this report is to show how statistical analysis helps us achieve pertinent conclusions even in simple surveys like the one done here. You can access the report by clicking [this link](https://github.com/Jonashellevang/IE_MBD_2020/blob/master/Math%20%26%20Statistics%20for%20Data%20Analysis/Inferential%20Statistics%20Report.pdf).

# [Natural Language Processing](https://github.com/Jonashellevang/IE_MBD_2020/tree/master/Natural%20Language%20Processing)
### NLP Class Exercises
#### [Language Models.ipynb](https://github.com/Jonashellevang/IE_MBD_2020/blob/master/Natural%20Language%20Processing/Class%20Exercises/Language%20Models.ipynb)
In this notebook we went through creating sentences from grams.

#### [NER.ipynb](https://github.com/Jonashellevang/IE_MBD_2020/blob/master/Natural%20Language%20Processing/Class%20Exercises/NER.ipynb)
In this practical lab we focused on one of the main Information Extraction methodologies: Named Entity Recognition (NER). NERs focus is to to detect and classify the names in the text. In the theoretical session we also presented three main methodologies to address the recognition of named entities:
* Hidden Markov Models
* MaxEnt Markov Models
* Conditional Random Fields

#### [POS Tagging.ipynb](https://github.com/Jonashellevang/IE_MBD_2020/blob/master/Natural%20Language%20Processing/Class%20Exercises/POS%20Tagging.ipynb)
In this notebook we went through the process of POS tagging.

#### [Semantics.ipynb](https://github.com/Jonashellevang/IE_MBD_2020/blob/master/Natural%20Language%20Processing/Class%20Exercises/Semantics.ipynb)
NLTK provides a useful WordNet interface to play with the WordNet data (included into the nltk.corpus). In this notebook we learned how to use it.

### Disaster Tweets (Kaggle)
On a general note, this assignment was in particular interesting because even though concepts and theory from class was understood, we still had not run any sort of machine learning process like this. It was not until after the process of EDA I understood that when we vectorize the text, creating new features and doing ‚Äúnormal‚Äù machine learning processes are completely different. For me, that was the biggest discovery of this assignment. The machine learning process is way different, and that highlights the importance of proper cleaning and processing of the text.

We used the Kaggle competiton [Real or Not? NLP with Disaster Tweets](https://www.kaggle.com/c/nlp-getting-started), and both the report and python notebook is incluced in this repository. You can access the notebook by clicking [this link](https://github.com/Jonashellevang/IE_MBD_2020/blob/master/Natural%20Language%20Processing/Disaster%20Tweets.ipynb) and the report can be accessed by clicking [this link](https://github.com/Jonashellevang/IE_MBD_2020/blob/master/Natural%20Language%20Processing/Disaster%20Tweets%20Report.pdf).

### The Great Firewall of China - State of the Art Report
Natural language processing techniques cover a wide variety of practical applications. NLP can be used for everything from judging sentiment to identifying spam, but one of the most dynamic applications is through encoding and decoding. While the idea of ‚Äúcodes‚Äù might bring to mind Indiana Jones movies, the modern use cases more often concern hiding content from government and private companies, and on the other hand, decoding said information. Tight censoring regulations in China have resulted in widespread use of modern language processing, with citizens developing an ever-evolving lexicon of codewords, while the government and social platforms try to keep up. This chase has led to a game of cat-and-mouse, that while deeply restrictive for the Chinese people, has also created practical applications for state-of-the-art natural language processing techniques. The report can be accessed by clicking the file "The Great Firewall of China Report.pdf" or by clicking [this link](https://github.com/Jonashellevang/IE_MBD_2020/blob/master/Natural%20Language%20Processing/The%20Great%20Firewall%20of%20China%20Report.pdf).

# [NoSQL (MongoDB,HBase)](https://github.com/Jonashellevang/IE_MBD_2020/tree/master/NoSQL%20(MongoDB%2CHBase))
### MongoDB and HBase Summary
I didn't have much work for HBase as it was not a part of an assignment. I therefore decided to upload my summary document I used to prepare for the Exam that I got full marks on. It's not the cleanest document as it was meant for personal use, but hopefully it will either help you or show you what I know.

# COVID-19 Global Forecasting (Kaggle)
In this assignment we tackle the COVID-19 prediction competition hosted on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/covid19-global-forecasting-week-4/overview). We first start by a general Exploratory Data Analysis, that can be accessed [here](https://github.com/Jonashellevang/IE_MBD_2020/blob/master/R%20-%20COVID19%20Global%20Forecasting%20/work_EDA.Rmd). However, I would recommend seeing the work where you can play with the EDA by clicking [this link](https://jonashellevang.shinyapps.io/COVID19_Forecasting_EDA/). We focus the EDA on the provided data, as well as external data to find more insights and information about the pandemic. We then try various modeling approaches ([time series model](https://github.com/Jonashellevang/IE_MBD_2020/blob/master/R%20-%20COVID19%20Global%20Forecasting%20/ts_model.R) and [machine learning model](https://github.com/Jonashellevang/IE_MBD_2020/blob/master/R%20-%20COVID19%20Global%20Forecasting%20/ml_model.R)) to predict the trends of the spread of the virus in the studied countries given. Our goal was to provide the most effective model, trying to include the most relevant information into our models.

### Shiny Application and Leaflet for Boston Housing Data
For an assignment in "Advanced R" class we were given some choices of datasets from where we were to build an interactive map using any mapping tool we wanted, and R-markdown file as well as a Shiny application. I chose the Boston Housing data. Where in Boston do you want your children to grow up? In thes map, you can see which areas is safer and where your children can get more time with their teacher. For you as a parent, or even if you don‚Äôt have kids, you can enjoy other selection criterions as well, including where you should live based on pricing and similar people like yourself. The result of the Shiny application can be viewed by clicking [this link](https://jonashellevang.shinyapps.io/Boston_Housing/), and the R-Markdown can be accessed by clicking [this link](https://github.com/Jonashellevang/IE_MBD_2020/blob/master/R%20-%20Shiny%20App%20with%20Leaflet%20in%20R-Markdown/Shiny%2C%20Leaflet%20and%20R-markdown.Rmd).

# [R - Solar Energy Prediction](https://github.com/Jonashellevang/IE_MBD_2020/tree/master/R%20-%20Solar%20Energy%20Prediction)
### AMS 2013-2014 Solar Energy Prediction Contest (Kaggle)
The goal of this contest was to discover which statistical and machine learning techniques provide the best short term predictions of solar energy production. We  predicted the total daily incoming solar energy at 98 Oklahoma Mesonet sites, which serves as "solar farms" for the [Kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/ams-2014-solar-energy-prediction-contest). The R-Markdown is published and can be viewed by clicking [this link](https://rpubs.com/jonashellevang/Exploratory_Data_Analysis).

The MAE score of our best SVM model on Kaggle was 2,290,458 (public) & 2,529,143 (private). This was also the best score amongst our peers in the class.

# [Recommendation Engines](https://github.com/Jonashellevang/IE_MBD_2020/tree/master/Recommendation%20Engines)
### Recommendation Engines: Business Case - Instagram
For this group assignment in "Recommendation Engines" class we had to describe a business case that uses at least one recsys, and for this we chose to write about Instagram. The main goal was to apply the strategic thinking we learned in class in a deeper way. If you want to read the report, you can access it by clicking [this link](https://github.com/Jonashellevang/IE_MBD_2020/blob/master/Recommendation%20Engines/Business%20Case%20-%20Instagram.pdf).

# [Reinforcement Learning (AWS)](https://github.com/Jonashellevang/IE_MBD_2020/tree/master/Reinforcement%20Learning%20(AWS))
### AWS Deep Racer
As an assingment for the class "Reinforcement Learning" we had to learn how to make a car drive by itself. Yes, I agree, it sounds like a cool assignment right? And it was, I think it was my favorite, and it was so addicting! I Built models in Amazon SageMaker where I trained, tested, and iterated quickly and easily on the track in the AWS DeepRacer 3D racing simulator. The youtube link to access the video can be viewed [here](https://youtu.be/nVsVUfC0EdE). Below you can see a GIF of my race and the scoreboard where I placed 3rd out of 17 participants in my group:

### Lunar Lander
For our first assignment in "Reinforcement Learning" I worked with the OpenAI's Lunar Lander gym. I used reinforcement learning (RL) to train a lunar lander vehicle in a Box2D simulation environment to land itself on the surface of the moon. I adjusted hyperparameters and the reward function as I considered appropriate, ran the training multiple times and compared the results. The notebook can be accessed [here](https://github.com/Jonashellevang/IE_MBD_2020/blob/master/Reinforcement%20Learning%20(AWS)/lunarlander.ipynb).

### Q-Learning Report and Presentation
As a group project in the class "Reinforcement Learning" we chose to dive deeper into the topic of Q-learning. Within reinforcement learning there are two main algorithm methods; model-based and model-free. To read the report you can click [this link](https://github.com/Jonashellevang/IE_MBD_2020/blob/master/Reinforcement%20Learning%20(AWS)/Q-Learning%20Report.pdf). The presentation can also be viewed [here](https://github.com/Jonashellevang/IE_MBD_2020/blob/master/Reinforcement%20Learning%20(AWS)/Q-Learning%20Presentation.pdf).

### Reinforcement Learning - Final Report
Due to the COVID situation our professor decided not to have an exam, rather we sent him a paper answering several questions. The report can be viewed [here](https://github.com/Jonashellevang/IE_MBD_2020/blob/master/Reinforcement%20Learning%20(AWS)/Reinforcement%20Learning%20-%20Final%20Report.pdf), and the report answers these questions:
1. What is Reinforcement Learning and how is it different from other methods like Supervised or Unsupervised Learning
2. What are Markov Decision Process (MDP) and Bellman‚Äôs equation?
3. What is a Dynamic Programming (DP) method and how is it different from MDP methods?
4. What is a Multi-armed Bandit problem, and what are example applications of it in real-life?
5. Explain 2 algorithms for solving a Multi-Armed Bandit problem
6. What is the difference between Model-based and Model-free RL methods?, describe a method for each
7. What is the difference between On-policy and Off-policy RL methods?, describe a method for each
8. What are the advantages and disadvantages of Monte Carlo (MC) methods vs Temporal Difference (TD) methods?
9. What is SARSA and how is it different from Q-learning?
10. Describe the following three RL algorithms, and how these work in high level:
* Principal Policy Optimization (PPO)
* Meta-Q-learning
* Asynchronous Advantage Actor Critic (A3C)

# [SQL](https://github.com/Jonashellevang/IE_MBD_2020/tree/master/SQL)
For our "SQL & Data Modelling" class we had two group assignments, one with some very basic queries to introduce us to SQL that can be viewed [here](https://github.com/Jonashellevang/IE_MBD_2020/blob/master/SQL/Simple%20Queries%20Group%20Assignment.pdf), and one with a little bit more advanced queries that can be accessed [here](https://github.com/Jonashellevang/IE_MBD_2020/blob/master/SQL/More%20Advanced%20Queries%20Group%20Assignment%202.pdf).

# [Smart Cities & Governments](https://github.com/Jonashellevang/IE_MBD_2020/tree/master/Smart%20Cities%20%26%20Governments)
###  Mlimi - Empowering Malawians
Smart Cities & Governments: The economy of Malawi, the southern Africa country, is predominantly based on agriculture. Indeed, agriculture accounts for 30% of GDP and generates over 80% of national export earnings. The sector employs more than 60% of the country‚Äôs workforce and greatly contributes to food and nutrition security. Although there is potential for better production and productivity, the agriculture sector has been operating greatly below its capacity and faces many challenges. Malawi is the third poorest country in the world with half the population living below the poverty line. To navigate our work and solution, we here give an overview of the deliverables and where they fit in:
* [PDF report](https://github.com/Jonashellevang/IE_MBD_2020/blob/master/Smart%20Cities%20%26%20Governments/Empowering%20Malawians%20Report.pdf): the full report explaining the problem and solution we came up with and our reasoning
* [Prototype Model Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/Jonashellevang/IE_MBD_2020/blob/master/Smart%20Cities%20%26%20Governments/Empowering%20Malawians%20Prototype.ipynb): as will be tackled in the report, we have developed a prototype machine learning model to illustrate one of our solutions. This is an illustration that our proposition could be implemented
* Javascript Google Earth Engine sample: We have extracted data from Google Earth Engine, as described in the report.

### Oslo as a Smart City
For this individual assignment in "Smart Cities & Governments" class we had to find ‚Äúuse cases‚Äù that a city of our own choice has implemented. I decided to write about Oslo, not only because I'm Norwegian and have lived there for 5 years, but also because it is one of the leading countries with smart city technology. If you want to read my work, you can access the report by clicking [this link](https://github.com/Jonashellevang/IE_MBD_2020/blob/master/Smart%20Cities%20%26%20Governments/Oslo%20as%20a%20Smart%20City%20Report.pdf).

# [Social Network Analysis (Python,R)](https://github.com/Jonashellevang/IE_MBD_2020/tree/master/Social%20Network%20Analysis%20(Python%2CR))
### Social Network Analysis Summary
I made this summary as a way to study for the Social Networks Analysis exam. In the file you can see the consepts covered in class. Click [this link](https://github.com/Jonashellevang/IE_MBD_2020/blob/master/Social%20Network%20Analysis%20(Python%2CR)/Social%20Network%20Analysis%20Summary.pdf).

### Work Migration
When we decided to pick this data we were looking forward to the challenges this would bring us, but we had no idea how it all would turn out both for our business case or graphs. What it turned out to be, was a data that only really made sense to get some of the centrality-measures out of. In order to get data that made sense, we cleaned our data and removed the variables that was duplicate in a sense of how we wanted to present our data.

In this assignment for "Social Network Analysis" class, using LinkedIn data based on migration from countries, I used different techniques to draw insights from the data. To see the presentation, click [this link](https://github.com/Jonashellevang/IE_MBD_2020/blob/master/Social%20Network%20Analysis%20(Python%2CR)/Work%20Migration%20Presentation.pdf).

# [Spark](https://github.com/Jonashellevang/IE_MBD_2020/tree/master/Spark)
### Analyzing Flight Data
According to a 2010 report made by the US Federal Aviation Administration, the economic price of domestic flight delays entails a yearly cost of 32.9 billion dollars to passengers, airlines and other parts of the economy. More than half of that amount comes from passengers' pockets, as they do not only waste time waiting for their planes to leave, but also miss connecting flights, spend money on food and have to sleep on hotel rooms while they're stranded. The work can be found through [this link](https://github.com/Jonashellevang/IE_MBD_2020/blob/master/Spark/Analyzing%20Flight%20Data.ipynb).

### San Francisco Flight Analysis
Although I wouldn‚Äôt say that San Francisco is known for its crime, rather for its bridge and steep hills and houses. Still crime is everywhere, and it is interesting to see how this can be reduced. So how can we help the police of San Francisco, or SFPD, with its crime fighting? I have focused the analysis on location, time and severity of crime, and by doing so we can provide SFPD with facts such as in what areas there is most crime, what day crime happens the most and where. The best way to view the work is to read the report by clicking [this link](https://github.com/Jonashellevang/IE_MBD_2020/blob/master/Spark/San%20Francisco%20Crime%20Analysis%20(2018%20until%20today)%20Report.pdf).

# [Streaming (Spark Stream,Kafka)](https://github.com/Jonashellevang/IE_MBD_2020/tree/master/Streaming%20(Spark%20Stream%2CKafka))
### Real-Time Streaming Sentiment from Twitter
For our group assignment in "Stream Processing & Real-Time Analytics" we had a presentation where we had to create a prototype based on using Real-Time Streaming. We decided to do real-time streaming from twitter using the sentiment of the topic chosen.

This is the file structure:
* The file ["twit.ipynb"](https://github.com/Jonashellevang/IE_MBD_2020/blob/master/Streaming%20(Spark%20Stream%2CKafka)/twit.ipynb) was used to connect to twitter.
* The file ["ReadTweets.ipynb"](https://github.com/Jonashellevang/IE_MBD_2020/tree/master/Streaming%20(Spark%20Stream%2CKafka)) was used to read the tweets.
* The file ["Mention_Analysis.ipynb"](https://github.com/Jonashellevang/IE_MBD_2020/blob/master/Streaming%20(Spark%20Stream%2CKafka)/Mention_Analysis.ipynb) was used to create the dashboard.

The presentation can be viewed by clicking [this link](https://github.com/Jonashellevang/IE_MBD_2020/blob/master/Streaming%20(Spark%20Stream%2CKafka)/Streaming%20Sentiment%20from%20Twitter%20Presentation.pdf).

### Twitter Streaming with Spark Stream and Kafka
Getting data from twitter in almost near real-time has many different use cases. For instance, a corporation may have the option to automatically track what people are tweeting about their brand in near real-time. Also, it may be possible to interact automatically with customers through twitter by developing a bot. Although this assignment is somewhat similar to the assignment above, it made me able to demonstrated my knowledge with Twitter. The report is quite self explanatory, so have a look at it by clicking [this link](https://github.com/Jonashellevang/IE_MBD_2020/blob/master/Streaming%20(Spark%20Stream%2CKafka)/Twitter%20Streaming%20with%20Spark%20Stream%20and%20Kafka%20Report.pdf).

# [YOLOv3 Tutorial](https://github.com/Jonashellevang/IE_MBD_2020/tree/master/YOLOv3%20Tutorial)
### YOLOv3 Object Detector For Detecting Guns - A Full Tutorial
As the fourth task in our group assignment 1 for "Machine Learning 3" class we had an optional exercise to create a YOLOv3 notebook to locate & classify different objects in a single image. For this assignment I decided to create a tutorial for others to learn the process that I have gone through learning how YOLOv3 works.

You Only Look Once (YOLO) is a neural network made for detecting objects and their location in the image created by Joseph Redmon. Yolov3 just means that it is the third verion of YOLO, and it is exciting news that YOLOv4 has already been launched in April 2020.

Object detection is a task in computer vision to detect objects, their location, their magnitude, and what they are. In other words, it is algorithms you use to classify images, is it a cat or a dog? YOLOv3 is in the category of Region Proposal Classification Network (RCNN), but compared to its‚Äô siblings, YOLO looks more like a Fully Convolutional Neural Network (FCNN). It is an algorithm using DarkNet and it is written in C.

Why do we use YOLO and not either one of the other deep learning algorithms for classifying images?
* YOLOv3 is much faster, where it reaches 45 frames per second, although it is no longer the most accurate where RetinaNet and SSD outperforms its' accuracy.
* Detects multiple objects within the same image.
* Widely used for videos due to its speed.

Each image is associated with a label file saved as .txt file, and to be able to get this we have three options; we can build them from scratch with our own pictures and labels using a tool, we can use already labeled images or we can use pre-trained models. YOLOv3 is basically just another state-of-the-art (SOA), real-time object detection system for images and videos.

To access the full tutorial you can click [this link](https://github.com/Jonashellevang/IE_MBD_2020/blob/master/YOLOv3%20Tutorial/Weapon%20Detection%20with%20YOLOv3.ipynb).
