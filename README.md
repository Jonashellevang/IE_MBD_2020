Here I have uploaded some of my files from my masters in Business Analytics & Big Data at IE School of Human Science and Technology. I will also share work done from competitions and other work done outside of school.

# ShinyApplication and Leaflet for Boston Housing Data
For an assignment in Advanced R we were given some choices of datasets from where we were to build an interactive map using any mapping tool we wanted, and R markdown file as well as a Shiny application. I chose the Boston Housing data and the result of the Shiny application can be viewed here: https://jonashellevang.shinyapps.io/Boston_Housing/
