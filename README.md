# [Computer Vision (YOLOv3)](https://github.com/Jonashellevang/IE_MBD_2020/tree/master/Computer%20Vision%20(YOLOv3))
### Protecting The Endangered - Saving Elephants With YOLOv3
The estimated population of elephants decreased from 12 million to 400 000 in the last century alone according to the WWF. Moreover, an estimated 20,000 elephants are poached for their tusks every year. Our aim of this "Computer Vision" project was to provide a solution where a drone would be sending real-time streams to a control room where our custom-trained object detector could help with:

1. Precise control of population of endangered species;
2. Poaching control;
3. Control of movement of animals in order to save them from especially dangerous
zones.

The notebook is quite long due to all the coding, but can be accessed by clicking [this link](https://github.com/Jonashellevang/IE_MBD_2020/blob/master/Computer%20Vision%20(YOLOv3)/Saving%20Elephants%20with%20YOLOv3.ipynb).

# [(1/3) Data Warehouse Modelling (MySQL)](https://github.com/Jonashellevang/IE_MBD_2020/tree/master/Data%20Warehouse%20Modelling%20(MySQL))
This was the first group assignment out of two in "Business Intelligence and Datawarehousing" class where we got delivered a dataset and as a group had to present a:
* Data Set analysis
* Data Warehouse Approach Selection
* Data Warehouse Design

# [(2/3) Data Integration Design (Pentaho)](https://github.com/Jonashellevang/IE_MBD_2020/tree/master/Data%20Integration%20Design%20(Pentaho))
This second assignment was focused on Data Integration with Pentaho. It consisted on designing a one-time historic data load using an ETL (Extraction, Transformation, Loading) tool. That means we had to create an ETL process for each dimension and fact table(s) from the previous assignment.

# [Data Visualization (Tableau,R,Carto,D3.js)](https://github.com/Jonashellevang/IE_MBD_2020/tree/master/Data%20Visualization%20(Tableau%2CR%2CCarto%2CD3.js))
### (3/3) Dashboard Design (Tableau)
This third assignment "Business Intelligence and Datawarehousing" class was done on an individual basis and focused on generating value from our datawarehouse by designing a dashboard using Tableau. You can play with the visualization by clicking [this link](https://public.tableau.com/profile/jonas.hellevang#!/vizhome/FederalCommunicationsCommissionCustomersandAntennas/Dashboard).

### One week of Jonas' Sleep (D3.js)
As a group assignment for our "Data Visualization" class we decided to create a visualization of my sleep where we chose a random week of the year. I have a love of electronic devices, and have tracked movement, sleep, and other health data for years through alarm clock's, weight scales, Apple Watch and my iPhone. It was fun to see how it was possible to visualize some of this data.
