# IE_MBD_2020
This repository contains projects carried out during my Master's in Business Analytics & Big Data program while at IE School of Human Science and Technology (IE University), as well as some projects carried out by my own initiative. Below you will find a short description of each folder and what projects they contain. Whitin each folder you will be able to find more extensive summaries and descriptions ot the projects.

# [Advanced Python](https://github.com/Jonashellevang/IE_MBD_2020/tree/master/Advanced%20Python)
### Package a Machine Learning Model
The task of this "Advanced Python" class assignment was to convert a machine learning model into a Python library that can be easily deployed. The folder can be accessed by [clicking this link](https://github.com/Jonashellevang/IE_MBD_2020/tree/master/Advanced%20Python/Package%20a%20Machine%20Learning%20Model).

### Deploy a Machine Learning Model
The task of this "Advanced Python" class assignment was to convert a Python library containing a reusable machine learning model into a web application with Flask. The folder can be accessed by [clicking this link](https://github.com/Jonashellevang/IE_MBD_2020/tree/master/Advanced%20Python/Deploy%20a%20Machine%20Learning%20Model).

# [Big Data & Health]()
### 23andMe: Genetic Testing for Consumers Report
For my "Big Data & Health" class we had to write a report based on our personal opinions about the case between the FDA in the USA and 23andMe.

### Healthcare Presentation
For my "Introduction to Big Data and Analytics" course we had to chose a topic of interest to present to the rest of our classmates. I chose to look further into the healthcare industry, and how this industry can be transformed the coming years.

### Lung Cancer (sckit-learn) Forum Post
In "Computer Vision" class we had to demonstrate the use of some image preprocessing techniques using sckit-learn. I wanted to see if there was any preprocessing techniques that would highlight the presence of cancer in a person's x-rays, and from experimenting with a few techniques, where I used thresholding.

### SmellAway - Personal Health Manager Presentation
As our last group project for "Big Data & Health" class we had to building an innovative data based product or service to improve the way people manage their health, with the goal of improving their health outcomes and customer health experience. Our answer to this was SmellAway!

### The Blood Test Makeover Presentation
The task in "Big Data & Health" class was to improve the way a typical blood test report conveys information using our dataviz skills and our intuitions about what could improve the patient experience. We created a prototype and presentation for this assignment.

### Your.md (Now Healthily) App Presentation
Your.md, now changed name to Healthily, is a free app where anyone, anywhere can find safe and personalised information, guidance and support for their health. This was a very quick presentation.
